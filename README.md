# Shop-Program
Object Oriented Programming course project

## What 
A shop program where we designed classes and their relationships. Through this project, we applied all the OOP concepts that were covered in the course (Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interface, exception handling, and Collections). Additionally, we provided the UML representation of the classes via a Class Diagram.
